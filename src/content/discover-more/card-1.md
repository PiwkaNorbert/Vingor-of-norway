The trademark Vingtor of Norway is a registered trademark owned and administered by Grafikk og Musikk AS.

We are based in Nordre follo municipality.

We are a small family-owned company with a clear vision. It is to create high quality products inspired by Norse mythology and our history and traditions. We believe it is important to continue our value base and our history is "woven" naturally into the products.

Our logo is the ravens Hugin and Munin. Every morning Hugin and Munin flew out into the world. Their names mean "Thought" and "Memory". The birds are symbols of Odin's intellectual power, while also being his personal reporters. Every evening they return to their master, sit one on each shoulder and whisper in Odin's ears what they have seen and heard. A news agency before the days of the internet!
