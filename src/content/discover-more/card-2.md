description: Norwegian wool is durable, has little knots and has very good elasticity and shine. It provides a beautiful yarn in addition to the fact that garments and textiles will retain their shape and form over time. Garments and textiles made of Norwegian wool have a long life and can be part of a more sustainable consumption. Both sweaters and national costumes are good examples of garments that are inherited and are just as fine for several generations.
